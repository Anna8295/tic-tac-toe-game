# Tic Tac Toe Game

This code is for a Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. Players can choose their game piece ('X' or 'O') and play as many rounds as they like. It manages the state of the game board and player moves. The user interface allows players to make moves and displays the game score.

## Tech Stack

- React 
- Tailwind 


## Lessons Learned

Organizing my code into reusable components helped me write more efficient and maintainable code, which will be valuable in future React projects
